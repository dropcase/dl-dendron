# Day number whatever of playing with Dendron

I think I can start planning out migration of content here once I have a few more things sorted out. That's the great thing with formats that aren't dependent on a platform or locked in a system. The biggest pain point is making sure the flavor of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and some frontmatter items, but that's really it!

Bonus when there's a clean way to do it, which means #automation time!

File under #RTFM - it's in the Dendron docs under importing! See [Importing Files](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f9b4fc21-7613-4c8a-9257-cec4c06b67f9/#importing-files), the second step handles the frontmatter setup.
