# Following the way you think

Every time I start using a new system, usually in the #PKM or #BASB space, I try to just "jump in" and add content based on how I think rather than building up a #framework to fill in with content.

I've been trying to find a system that allows me to get things out of my head and captured as easily as possible. It hasn't been easy at times but some systems have been better than others. There's been an evolution of the apps and systems that have stuck (for me) over the years, and I've realized that the best thing is the one I keep using.

A lot of the time there isn't a noticeable benefit until you need it for something other than capturing. That might be a reminder for a task, figuring out the last time you visited a certain restaurant, or where you left the extension cord when you last put it away. It's when you can start finding connections between thoughts and ideas that you find one of the benefits.

Another big plus is when the system kind of drops back to be almost invisible. I've been caught up in the process of setting everything up to be "just right" to the point of either not using the system, or feeling like it was stopping me from using it correctly.
